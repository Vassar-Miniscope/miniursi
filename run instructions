1) Open terminal  & minian environment.
2) Upload the pipeline in the minian directory of the environment and the config file (once you have altered it to your liking)
   in the next minian directory (where all the other .py files for the program are located). On following runs you can leave 
   these where they are and just alter the config file.
3) In the terminal, change directory to where the pipeline file is and call $ ipython ursi_pipeline.py
